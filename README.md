This is a laravel project that implements an api structure to exploit the database. No front end has been
set up. There’s a User,User_data and Wallet models.
Each user has his/her set of data and also a set of wallets. There’s an endpoint that allows users to
transact funds from one wallet to another.
More tests might be needed.
Improvements are encouraged.
